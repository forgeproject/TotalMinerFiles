  Hello fellow Total Miners I hope you find the info here helpful and if you have any tips or advice let me know and I will try to get to them. If you are new to Total Miner 
  and are looking to learn here is the right place. I will be posting all my mods here in hope it will help guide you to making some yourself. If you need help with the game mode I
  will be working on adding a tutorial for both Dig Deep and Survival so keep a lookout for that.
